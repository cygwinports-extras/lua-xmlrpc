ldesc: "LuaXMLRPC is a library to make remote procedure calls using XML-RPC. 
It also offers facilities to develop server-side software.

LuaXMLRPC provides a simple API and an abstraction layer over XML
avoiding manipulation of string representation of data structures. It
also offers ways to express everything when needed."
